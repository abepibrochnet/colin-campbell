Colin Campbell’s Instrumental Book 1797
=======================================
_**A Diplomatic Copy**_
Roderick D. Cannon

## Preface

This work was in the final stages of proofreading when the world of Highland piping lost its greatest living scholar on 8 June 2015. It was Roderick Cannon’s intention to publish it online, open access, and plans had reached an advanced stage shortly before his untimely passing. He was concerned that it should be made available in a way that performers and researchers found helpful, and that any mistakes and inconsistencies that were found would be corrected.

Roderick sent me his first complete draft in January 2014. This publication incorporates revisions he made since that date, found in a hard copy kindly made available by his wife, Elizabeth Cannon. Following the model David Hester and I developed with Roderick’s assistance at altpibroch.com for his similarly epic study of Gaelic tune titles, this aims to be a living resource, implementing revisions swiftly.

From the unpublished material Roderick shared with me at various stages since December 2010, when he solicited my feedback on a first experiment, I have edited an Introduction; this is largely in Roderick’s words. David Hester has turned the 176 Word documents into an interconnected online resource by adding links in the header of each document: one to the “stable” where we will curate updates, revision history and introductory material; and one to the relevant “tune page” where a facsimile of Colin Campbell’s manuscript may be consulted alongside other material on the same tune.

If you spot any mistakes, please let us know by writing to barnaby (at) pibroch (dot) net. Note that Roderick preserved Campbell’s apparently random choice between “F” and “ff”, whereas experts in eighteenth-century Scottish handwriting generally read initial “ff” as a variant form of the capital letter F (see [www.scottishhandwriting.com/cmPScap.asp](http://www.scottishhandwriting.com/cmPScap.asp) and [www.scottishhandwriting.com/cmPSdou.asp](http://www.scottishhandwriting.com/cmPSdou.asp)).

## Introduction

This diplomatic copy aims to reproduce exactly what is in the four sources: C0, CK, C1, and C2. It keeps to the original spellings, capital letters and punctuation; it keeps the original line-breaks and page-breaks; and it tries to show the actual positions of words on the page, e.g. in the margin, centred, in a corner. It also shows all the alterations as far as I can make them out. This makes it rather hard to read as it stands, but relatively easy to proof-read against the original. For the two large volumes, C1 and C2, I have worked from a printed scan of the NLS microfilm provided by Barnaby Brown in 1997, and in places where this is not clear I have used the handwritten copies of the manuscripts belonging to the Piobaireachd Society. Gradually, everything is being rechecked against the original manuscripts.

## Editing conventions

Page numbers are included and the style is preserved thus 1P,... P 4th...

The swung dash or tilde "~" represents a similarly shaped dash in the text or a longer dash with several similar waves. At the end of a line it represents a continuous wavy stroke filling out the line.

In the text, a tilde over the letters "a" or "o" thus, "ã" or "õ", may extend over the next letter.

Two hyphens "\-\-" stand for a ruled line filling out the line.

Single strike-through thus "~~hin~~" denotes letters struck through (the text may have a double strike-through).

Subscript denotes letters overwritten, the overwriting being shown immediately after, thus "hi~m~en" evidently first written "himen" then altered to "hinen".

Asterix "\*" denotes a letter that has been overwritten, the overwriting being shown immediately after, but the overwritten letter not indicated. Thus "hida\*rid" now reads "hidarid", but some other letter was written after "a" before it was overwritten.

Letter "x" struck through "~~x~~"  denotes a  letter blotted out or otherwise illegible.

Forward slash in parentheses thus "hihor(/o)do" denotes an insertion over a caret. Thus in this case the text reads "hihordo", with an insertion caret low down between "r" and "d", and the letter "o" written above.

Hyphens, single – and double =, are single and double in the text, but sometimes slanted.

Parentheses (round brackets) enclose a letter which has evidently been squeezed in to the text but on the line.

Square brackets "[ ]" enclose letters or words interpolated by the present editor. **Only rarely used and only to make clear there is not a typo in the present version.**

Double square bracket thus "[[Turn Over" denotes a curved bracket surrounding much of what follows.

Angle brackets "< >" enclose letters or words which seem to be redundant. **Only rarely used and only to make clear there is not a typo in the present version.**

Curly brackets "{ }" enclose letters or words which have apparently been lost where a page was damaged. In some places, curly brackets "{ }" enclose letters or words which could not be read on the photocopies. They have been supplied here editorially or from some secondary source and will be corrected in due course from the original.
